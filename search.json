    "text": "My name is David Kane, and I am an instructor at New College of Florida. This is the location of the GitHub repo for this project. The data for the project comes from the system data page for the Citibike program. The repo includes all the code for replicating the analysis on this website. It does not include the raw data, which you would need to download yourself. I made extensive use of Deep Seek.\n\nHistory of the Citi Bike Program\nThe Citi Bike program, launched on May 27, 2013, is one of the largest and most successful bike-sharing systems in the United States. It began in New York City as a public-private partnership between the city’s Department of Transportation and Alta Bicycle Share (later replaced by Motivate and then Lyft). The program was sponsored by CitiBank, which contributed $41 million in initial funding, earning naming rights for the system.\nCiti Bike started with 6,000 bikes and 330 docking stations across Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. Its goal was to provide an affordable, sustainable, and convenient transportation option for New Yorkers and visitors, reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Despite early challenges, including software glitches and supply shortages, the program quickly gained popularity, with over 100,000 annual members in its first year.\nBy 2019, Citi Bike had expanded to over 12,000 bikes and 750 stations, covering Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City. The introduction of electric bikes (e-bikes) in 2018 further boosted ridership, offering a faster and more accessible option for riders. In 2020, Lyft acquired Motivate and integrated Citi Bike into its transportation ecosystem, expanding the program’s reach and technological capabilities.\nToday, Citi Bike is a cornerstone of New York City’s transportation network, with over 25,000 bikes and 1,500 stations across all five boroughs. It has facilitated millions of rides annually, promoting healthier lifestyles, reducing reliance on cars, and contributing to the city’s sustainability goals. The program’s success has inspired similar bike-sharing initiatives in cities worldwide, solidifying its legacy as a pioneer in urban mobility."
